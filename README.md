# conversation-manager for Mo++

Mo++ is a web project for creating chatting bots. Everyone can create a chatting bot easily in our website by draging and editing a flow chart.

This program is the background of Mo++. It supplies APIs of bots' CRUD, keeps the whole system running and makes data persistence.

But the project stopped already. And this code is not completed.
